1. Setup Instructions:-
Install Dependencies Make sure all the required dependencies are installed.

2. Update File Paths Check if there are any file paths in the code that are specific to local machine. For example, in the playMusic() function, there's a directory path (music_dir) that should be updated to point to the correct location of your music files on the server.

3. Configure API Keys Code uses any external APIs (like the OpenWeatherMap API or the News API), make sure you have the necessary API keys and that they are correctly configured. Update the relevant sections of the code with your API keys.
